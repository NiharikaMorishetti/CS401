**Describe some benifits of object-oriented programming**

1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting
2. Reuse of code through inheritance
3. Flexibility through polymorphism
4. Effective problem solving

**Describe the genesis of the Unified Method**

1. In the late 1980s, many people proposed object-oriented methodologis. 
2. By the mid-1990s, three proposals stood out: the **Object Modeling Technique**, the **Objectory Process**, and the **Booch Method**.
3. Between 1994 and 1997, the primary authors of these proposals got together and consolidated their ideas. The resulting methodology was the Unified Method.

**explain the relationships among classes, objects, and applications**

* A class defines the structure of an object. 
* A class definition includes variables and methods that determine the behavior of an object.
* Objects are created from classes at run time.
* Objects can contain and manipulate data.
* The class that contains the main method is called a Java application.

**explain how method calls are bound to method implementations with respect to inheritance**
