**Describe some benifits of object-oriented programming**

1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting
2. Reuse of code through inheritance
3. Flexibility through polymorphism
4. Effective problem solving

**Describe the genesis of the Unified Method**

1. In the late 1980s, many people proposed object-oriented methodologis. 
2. By the mid-1990s, three proposals stood out: the **Object Modeling Technique**, the **Objectory Process**, and the **Booch Method**.
3. Between 1994 and 1997, the primary authors of these proposals got together and consolidated their ideas. The resulting methodology was the Unified Method.

**explain the relationships among classes, objects, and applications**

* A class defines the structure of an object. 
* A class definition includes variables and methods that determine the behavior of an object.
* Objects are created from classes at run time.
* Objects can contain and manipulate data.
* The class that contains the main method is called a Java application.

**explain how method calls are bound to method implementations with respect to inheritance**

**describe, at an abstract level, the following structures: array, linked list, stack, queue, list, tree, map, and graph**

1. **array:**  is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) consisting of a collection of *elements* ([values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) or [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming))), each identified by at least one *array index* or *key*. 
2. **linked list:** is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Each pointing to the next node by means of a [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)). It is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) consisting of a group of [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)) which together represent a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence).
3. **stack:** is an access-controlled structure in which elements are added or removed from only one end, a LIFO structure. pop, push, top.
4. **queue:**  is an access-controlled group of elements in which new elements are added at one end (the "rear") and elements are removed from the other end (the "front"). enqueue, dequeue.
5. **list:** is an [abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) that represents a countable number of ordered [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)), where the same value may occur more than once.
6. **tree:**
