## Knowledge Goals

**define recursion**

* A recursive definition is a definition in which something is defined in terms of smaller versions of itself.

**discuss recursion as a problem-solving technique**

**describe the three questions used to analyze a recursive approach**

1. *The Base-Case Question*  	Is there a nonrecursive way out of the algorithm, and does the algorithm work correctly for this base case?
2. *The Smaller-Caller Question*       Does each recursive call to the algorithm involve a smaller case of the original problems, leading inescapably to the base case?
3. *The General-Case Question*       Assuming the recursive call(s) to the smaller case(s) works correctly, does the algorithm work correctly for the general case?

**do the following, given a recursive-problem description:**

* determine the base cases 
* determine the general cases
* design the solution using recursion

**compare and contrast dynamic and static storage allocation **

**explain how recursion works internally by showing the contents of the run-time stack**

**explain why recursion may or may not be a good choice to implement the solution of a problem**

## Skill Goals

**do the following, given a recursive method:**

* determine under what conditions the method halts
* determine the base cases
* determine the general cases
* determine what the method does
* determine whether the method is correct and, if it is not, correct it

**verify a recursive method, using the Three-Question Approach**

1. *The Base-Case Question*  	Is there a nonrecursive way out of the method, and does the method work correctly for this base case? If the doTowers method is passed an argument equal to 1 for the number of rings (parameter n), it prints the move, correctly recording the movement of a single ring from startPeg to endPeg, and skips the body of the else statement. No recursive calls are made. This response is appropriate because there is only one ring to move and no smaller rings to worry about. The answer to the base-case question is yes.
2. *The Smaller-Caller Question*        Does each recursive call to the method
