# Knowledge Goals

- describe some benefits of object-oriented programming
- describe the genesis of the Unified Method
- explain the relationships among classes, objects, and applications
- explain how method calls are bound to method implementations with respect to inheritance
- describe, at an abstract level, the following structures: array, linked list, stack, queue, list, tree, map, and graph
- identify which structures are implementation dependent and which are implementation independent
- describe the difference between direct addressing and indirect addressing
- explain the subtle ramifications of using references/pointers
- explain the use of O notation to describe the amount of work done by an algorithm
- describe the sequential search, binary search, and selection sort algorithms



# Skill Goals

- interpret a basic UML class diagram
- design and implement a Java class
- create a Java application that uses the Java class
- use packages to organize Java compilation units
- create a Java exception class
- throw Java exceptions from within a class and catch them within an application that uses the class
- predict the output of short segments of Java code that exhibit aliasing
- declare, initialize, and use one- and two-dimensional arrays in Java, including both arrays of a primitive type and arrays of objects
- given an algorithm, identify an appropriate size representation and determine its order of growth
- given a section of code determine its order of growth
