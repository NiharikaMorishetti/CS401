# Knowledge Goals

- define recursion
- discuss recursion as a problem-solving technique
- describe the three questions used to analyze a recursive approach
- do the following, given a recursive-problem description:
  - determine the base cases
  - determine the general cases
  - design the solution using recursion


- compare and contrast dynamic and static storage allocation 
- explain how recursion works internally by showing the contents of the run-time stack
- explain why recursion may or may not be a good choice to implement the solution of a problem

# Skill Goals
