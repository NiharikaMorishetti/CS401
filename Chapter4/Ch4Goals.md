# Knowledge Goals

- describe a queue and its operations at an abstract level
- define a queue interface
- describe algorithms for implementing queue operations using an array
- compare fixed and floating-front approaches to an array-based implementation of a queue
- explain how to implement an unbounded queue using arrays
- describe algorithms for implementing queue operations using a linked list
- use order of growth analysis to describe and compare the efficiency of queue algorithms
- define interarrival time, service time, turnaround time, and waiting time for elements on a queue
- explain how concurrent threads can interfere with each other resulting in errors, and how such interference can be prevented

# Skill Goals

- implement the bounded Queue ADT using an array
- implement the unbounded Queue ADT using an array
- implement the unbounded Queue ADT using a linked list
- draw diagrams showing the effects of queue operations for a particular implementation of a queue
- use the Queue ADT as a component of an application
- calculate turnaround and waiting times for queue elements, given arrival times and service requirements
- use our queue simulation system to investigate properties of real-world queues
- implement a program that properly uses threads to take advantage of the parallelism inherent within a problem solution
