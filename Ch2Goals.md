# Knowledge Goals

- explain the following terms and their relationships: abstraction, information hiding, data abstraction, data encapsulation, and abstract data type (ADT)
- describe the benefits of using an abstract data type
- define, for the Java programming language, the meanings of abstract method and interface
- describe the benefits of using a Java interface to specify an ADT
- list three options for making a collection ADT generally usable
- explain three ways to “handle” exceptional situations when defining an ADT
- describe the Stack ADT from three perspectives: abstract level, application level, and implementation level
- classify a given stack operation as a constructor, observer, or transformer
- describe an algorithm for determining whether grouping symbols (such as parentheses) within a string are balanced, using a stack
- describe an algorithm for evaluating postfix expressions, using a stack

# Skill Goal

- use the Java interface construct to formally specify an ADT
- specify the preconditions and postconditions (effects) of a public method
- use the Java generics mechanism when designing and/or implementing and/or using an ADT
- define and use a self-referential class to build a linked list 
- draw figures representing a sequence of operations on a linked list
- implement the Stack ADT using an array
- implement the Stack ADT using the Java library’s **ArrayList** class
- implement the Stack ADT using a linked list
- draw diagrams showing the effect of stack operations for a particular implementation of a stack
- determine the order of growth efficiency of stack implementation operations
- throw Java exceptions from within an ADT and catch them within an application that uses the ADT
- evaluate a postfix expression “by hand”
- use the Stack ADT as a component of an application
